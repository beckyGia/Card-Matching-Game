# Card-Matching-Game

This project is a simple memory game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game board consists of 16 cards arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different images on one side. The cards are shuffled on the grid with the image side down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match in 100 seconds!
